Dom xss
On the product pages, notice that the dangerous JavaScript extracts a storeId parameter from the location.search source. It then uses document.write to create a new option in the select element for the stock checker functionality.
Add a storeId query parameter to the URL and enter a random alphanumeric string as its value. Request this modified URL.
In your browser, notice that your random string is now listed as one of the options in the drop-down list.
Right-click and inspect the drop-down list to confirm that the value of your storeId parameter has been placed inside a select element.
Change the URL to include a suitable XSS payload inside the storeId parameter as follows:
product?productId=1&storeId="></select><img%20src=1%20onerror=alert(1)>
